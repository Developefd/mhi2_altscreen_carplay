## Cross-firmware corpus

The first six-baseline MHI2 corpus pass is **complete and verified**.

It covers:

- Audi AUG22 K3346 MU1438;
- Škoda SKG13 P4526 MU1440;
- Škoda SKG11 K3343 MU1433;
- Volkswagen VWG11 K3342 MU1427;
- SEAT SEG11 P4709 MU1447;
- Volkswagen VWG13 K4525 MU1367.

Important result: train names do not map one-to-one to implementation profiles.

Examples:

- Audi MU1438 and VWG11 share a byte-identical complete `libairplay.so`;
- MU1440, SEG11 and VWG13 share another byte-identical AirPlay profile;
- SKG11 has a distinct AirPlay file but the 16 project target functions match the Audi profile;
- SKG11 and VWG11 have different JXE containers but exactly the same 25,892 recovered class paths
  and class bytes;
- 97 of 98 `de/vw/mib/asl/internal/mostkombi/` classes are byte-identical across the five
  Škoda/VW/SEAT baselines;
- profile-forming native services split SKG11/VWG11 toward the MU1438 family and SEG11/VWG13 toward
  the MU1440 family.

The completed corpus run passed a 74,574-file independent rehash, 12 targeted Ghidra runs with zero
export failures, and a curated 45-file evidence hash audit.

AU37X P5089/MU1326 has now been processed as a standalone seventh corpus profile. P5153/MU1326
was not found locally, so there is still no same-family P5089↔P5153 equivalence result.

P5089 adds a distinct AirPlay/native profile and Audi `fwhmi` Java ownership. Its static startup
still shows the familiar `devp-iso-mmx-mib2 -S188 -P64 -Q18 ... -MisoTX2` low-level MOST
contract, while `force_kombi_type=lvds` and the fitted-cluster productive route remain separate
runtime questions.

Before another firmware family is admitted, the remaining P5089 evidence-closure items are:

- independent 89,922-row disk rehash;
- exact eight-class NavIgnore compatibility matrix;
- explicit Audi presence/absence gate for Most20FPS / Direct-VC Java classes;
- small native-evidence Git-blob audit;
- supporting-native and prior-art reconciliation.

The canonical AUG22/MU1438 corpus target remains `MHI2_ER_AUG22_K3346_MU1438`.

## Current leading diagnosis

The project is no longer blocked on basic media feasibility.

The leading open problem is:

> **correct receiver-side CarPlay secondary-display/UI ownership and same-session refresh during
> navigation lifecycle changes.**

In practical terms:

```text
working Apple Maps in VC
        │
        ▼
navigation provider / route state changes
        │
        ▼
same type-111 stream may remain alive
        │
        ├── UI suggestion changes
        ├── navigation ownership changes
        ├── SecondDisplayMode may change
        ├── source may need presentation reacquire
        └── bitstream may need keyframe restart
                │
                ▼
       receiver must keep all states coherent
```

---

## Current trace questions

The next controlled vehicle trace should answer:

1. Does type 111 actually teardown/re-SETUP during the failing handover?
2. If not, do fresh H.264 access units continue?
3. What `suggestUI` sequence is emitted?
4. What `modesChanged` / ownership transition occurs?
5. Does the receiver receive or send `showUI` / `stopUI`?
6. Does a bounded same-session reacquire restore source output?
7. Does a fresh config + complete IDR reach the consumer?
8. If delivered video progresses, does the VC route still remain stale?

Only the last case justifies making downstream MOST/presenter behavior the primary suspect again.

## Deferred until lifecycle is stable

- multi-ViewArea layouts;
- Knob/HID integration;
- maneuver-card layout polish;
- speculative type 112;
- local composition;
- additional decoder/encoder pipeline;
- broad RGI/BAP integration;
- cross-brand packaging;
- SD-card end-user installation.

---

## Project rule

A new finding should move between these categories only when there is evidence.

The repository should clearly distinguish:

```text
observed
  !=
inferred
  !=
implemented
  !=
vehicle-proven
```

That distinction is intentional: the goal is to make future work start from a known evidence state
instead of repeating earlier speculation.

## 2026-10-03 cluster research closeout

The LIVI/current-iOS/CarPlay-Ultra follow-up is consolidated in
[CARPLAY_CLUSTER_ULTRA_CLOSEOUT_2026-10-03.md](../research/CARPLAY_CLUSTER_ULTRA_CLOSEOUT_2026-10-03.md).

For the current milestone, the static-research questions around classic cluster URL roles,
ViewArea/SafeArea semantics and LIVI's restart behavior are closed. The optional local
CP111-plus-instruments compositor is preserved there as **DEFERRED**, not as a current implementation
requirement.
