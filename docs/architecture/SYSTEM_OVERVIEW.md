## 1. The problem in one picture

The project is trying to reproduce the complete **CarPlay secondary-display navigation path** on
Volkswagen Group MHI2 systems and present that video in the MQB Virtual Cockpit.

The important word is **complete**.

Getting H.264 pixels from the iPhone into the cluster is only one half of the problem. The receiver
also has to participate in CarPlay's auxiliary-screen lifecycle: advertise the display, expose the
right capabilities, track the active UI context, react to navigation ownership changes, request the
correct presentation and keep the existing stream synchronized.

The media path is already proven end-to-end on the current Škoda MU1440 reference platform: Apple
Maps has been rendered visibly in the real Virtual Cockpit through the direct Type-111 -> H.264 ->
MPEG-TS -> MOST path.

The remaining work is mainly about **lifecycle and ownership correctness**.

---

## 2. Two planes: media and control

The project deliberately separates the system into two planes.

### 2.1 Media plane

The media plane carries the navigation image.

```text
CarPlay Auxiliary / ScreenAlt
        │
        ▼
AirPlay screen stream type 111
        │
        ▼
Screen encryption / session handling
        │
        ▼
H.264 access units
        │
        ▼
direct-ts-remux
        │
        ▼
MPEG-TS
        │
        ▼
/dev/mlb/isoTX2
        │
        ▼
MOST150
        │
        ▼
Virtual Cockpit
```

On the current target this path is no longer theoretical. It is the proven baseline and should not
be redesigned without contradictory vehicle evidence.

### 2.2 Control plane

The control plane decides **whether the secondary display exists, which UI is intended for it, who
owns it and when the current stream needs to be refreshed**.

Relevant concepts include:

```text
receiver display/capability advertisement
              │
              ├── ScreenAlt / Auxiliary screen
              ├── type 111
              ├── initial URL
              ├── ViewArea(s)
              └── optional input/HID capabilities

iPhone navigation state
              │
              ├── navigation ownership
              ├── modesChanged / app state
              └── suggestUI([...])

receiver-side UI selection
              │
              ├── showUI
              ├── stopUI
              ├── changeModes / SecondDisplayMode
              ├── ViewArea changes
              └── forceKeyFrame
```

A major lesson from the research is:

> **A live Type-111 socket is not the same thing as correct CarPlay UI ownership.**

The stream can still exist while the wrong app/context is selected, while the sender is no longer
producing fresh content for the intended context, or while the receiver needs to refresh the
existing presentation.

---

## 3. CarPlay secondary display lifecycle

Current sender-side reverse engineering supports a persistent Auxiliary/ScreenAlt object that is
created as part of endpoint feature/stream setup.

A normal navigation app change is **not** itself a reason to destroy and recreate Type-111.

```text
CarPlay endpoint/session
        │
        ├── create Auxiliary/ScreenAlt stream
        │      └── Type 111
        │
        ├── navigation starts
        │      ├── UI candidates change
        │      └── ownership/mode state changes
        │
        ├── navigation provider changes
        │      ├── UI candidates may change
        │      ├── ownership changes
        │      └── same Type-111 generation normally remains
        │
        └── actual endpoint topology/session change
               └── only here may 111 really be torn down/recreated
```

### Real Type-111 generation boundaries

The implementation should only treat the stream as a new generation when there is actual transport
or session evidence, for example:

- a partial AirPlay TEARDOWN for type 111;
- a fresh type-111 SETUP;
- changed stream connection identity;
- changed session generation;
- socket/session death;
- another explicitly observed endpoint-topology change.

Normal app ownership, `suggestUI`, SecondDisplayMode or ViewArea transitions should not be converted
into synthetic teardown/SETUP cycles.

---

## 4. Cluster UI contexts

CarPlay exposes multiple logical instrument-cluster contexts.

Current mapping:

| URL | Working interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| `maps:/car/instrumentcluster` | generic/root instrument-cluster context |
| `maps:/car/instrumentcluster/map` | persistent map presentation |
| `maps:/car/instrumentcluster/instructioncard` | transient maneuver/instruction-card presentation |

Typical sender-side state:

```text
navigation active
  -> suggestUI([base, map])

maneuver card visible
  -> suggestUI([instructioncard, map, base])

maneuver card hidden
  -> suggestUI([map, base])

trip finish/cancel
  -> suggestUI([])
```

These are **UI roles inside the existing secondary-display architecture**, not three different
screen streams.

---

## 5. Effective UI capability is an intersection

The iPhone does not blindly assume that every requested cluster context is available.

The effective candidate set is the intersection of:

```text
app/provider requested UI contexts
                ∩
iOS/session cluster contexts
                ∩
receiver-advertised AltScreen contexts
                │
                ▼
          effective URLs
                │
                ▼
             suggestUI
```

This makes receiver advertisement important. A receiver can have a working type-111 media path and
still fail higher-level CarPlay behavior if the UI/capability surface is incomplete or inconsistent.

---

## 6. Current MU1440 receiver profile

The current first-generation GEN2 work deliberately uses a conservative, no-HID single-view
secondary-display profile.

Reference engineering profile:

```text
type=111
maxFPS=30
features=0
primaryInputDevice=<absent>
widthPixels=1010
heightPixels=376
widthPhysical=200
heightPhysical=74
initialURL=maps:/car/instrumentcluster
viewAreas=1
initialViewArea=0
drawUIOutsideSafeArea=false
viewAreaTransitionControl=false
```

This is not claimed to be the final cross-platform profile.

Knob/HID support and multi-ViewArea behavior are deliberately deferred until the exact target
registration contract is proven on the relevant firmware.

---

## 7. Video ownership inside MHI2

Even after CarPlay is correct, the MHI2 side has another ownership problem: the stock DisplayManager
normally writes the native navigation MPEG-TS into the same Kombi channel that the custom path needs.

The vehicle-proven takeover is deliberately narrow:

```text
                         DisplayManager
                              │
                        stock MPEG-TS
                              │
                              ▼
                 process-local isoTX2 write gate
                     │                    │
                   STOCK                DIRECT
                     │                    │
              real writev()        swallow payload,
                     │              report success
                     ▼                    │
              /dev/mlb/isoTX2             │
                     ▲                    │
                     │                    │
              custom direct writer ───────┘
                     │
              CarPlay MPEG-TS
```

The gate affects only DisplayManager's own `isoTX2` writes. DisplayManager stays alive and its
higher-level state machine continues running; the custom writer is a separate process and remains
able to send strict 12032-byte MPEG-TS blocks to the same transport.

Vehicle testing proved both directions:

```text
STOCK  -> native map visible
DIRECT -> native payload suppressed -> custom video visible
STOCK  -> native map returns
```

A separate Java Direct-VC policy line exists for DSI/display-state research, but it is **not** the
current proven video takeover mechanism.

See [DIRECT_VC_VIDEO_PATH.md](DIRECT_VC_VIDEO_PATH.md) for the exact transport, 64×188-byte write
contract, gate behavior, NavIgnore role and stock recovery sequence.

---

## 8. Why the current problem is not "how do we send video?"

That question has already been answered.

The higher-value question is now:

```text
When the navigation provider or UI context changes...

  does iOS keep the same Type-111 stream?        -> normally yes
  does it continue producing new H.264?          -> must be observed
  does suggestUI change?                         -> often yes
  does the receiver select/refresh that UI?      -> current focus
  is a keyframe/restart needed?                  -> possibly
  does VC ownership remain correct?              -> must remain correct
```

The current engineering target is therefore the **same-session handover path**, not another media
transport rewrite.

See [SCREENALT_CONTROL_PLANE.md](SCREENALT_CONTROL_PLANE.md).

## 9. Areas intentionally deferred

These are useful later, but are not allowed to distract from the primary lifecycle problem:

- multi-ViewArea layout polish;
- Knob/HID integration;
- speculative maneuver-card "stream 112";
- local map/card composition;
- decoder/re-encoder pipelines;
- wholesale Audi renderer ports;
- broad BAP/HMI replacement;
- MOST redesign without evidence;
- SD-card one-click installation.

The project should first make the standard CarPlay Auxiliary/ScreenAlt path stable across navigation
start/stop and app handover.
