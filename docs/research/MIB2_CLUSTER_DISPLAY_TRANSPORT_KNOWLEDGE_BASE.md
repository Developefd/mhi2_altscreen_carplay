# MIB2-era Virtual Cockpit / AID display transport knowledge base

**Scope:** Volkswagen Group digital instrument clusters relevant to the MIB2 / MHI2 development period, roughly 2015-2021.  
**Last research pass:** 2026-09-28.

This document intentionally separates four things that are often mixed together:

1. the **physical panel resolution** of the instrument cluster;
2. the **navigation/video surface** supplied by the infotainment unit;
3. the **transport** used between infotainment and cluster;
4. the **software/API path** used to control ownership, layout and metadata.

A panel being 1440x540 or 1280x480 does **not** imply that the infotainment unit sends a full-panel framebuffer at that geometry.

## Evidence labels

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **OEM-confirmed** | Audi/VW/Škoda service or official technical material |
| **Vehicle-proven** | reproduced on a real vehicle in this project |
| **Community-proven** | demonstrated by an open implementation / repeatable retrofit evidence |
| **Config-confirmed** | present in an original target configuration, but not yet proven active on the exact vehicle |
| **Hypothesis** | useful working model that still needs target-specific evidence |

## Capability matrix

| Cluster family / examples | Approx. MIB2 era | Physical panel | Navigation/video input from 5F/J794 | Map codec / transport | External map/renderer geometry | Evidence / notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Audi Virtual Cockpit Gen1 — A4 B9/8W, A5 F5 and related MIB2 vehicles** | ~2015-2019 pre-MIB3 | 12.3", early VC family commonly 1440x540 | **LVDS from J794 to J285 for the large navigation map and detailed intersection map** | LVDS for map; MOST for list menus/covers and J285 software update; Infotainment CAN for other content | full external map geometry not frozen here | **OEM-confirmed.** This is architecturally different from the MQB MOST-map path. |
| **Audi "Top" non-VC cluster with navigation** | same generation | analog instruments + center display | J794 -> J285 | **MOST carries navigation data including map**; CAN carries other content | target-specific | **OEM-confirmed.** Important counterexample: Audi MIB2 can use MOST for maps when the fitted cluster is not Virtual Cockpit. |
| **Audi "Medium" non-VC cluster** | same generation | analog / smaller center display | no external map interface | no LVDS and no MOST interface for map | n/a | **OEM-confirmed.** |
| **VW AID Gen1 / AD1 — Golf 7, Passat B8, Tiguan, Arteon family** | ~2016-2020 | **12.3", 1440x540** | infotainment navigation map into cluster | **MOST streaming + H.264** on MIB2 coding/retrofit path | **800x480 default renderer window for the older `...791` family in OneB1t**; this is not the panel raster | **OEM panel resolution + community-proven MOST/H.264.** OneB1t supports e.g. 3G0920791, 5NA920791, 5G1920791/794/795/798, 3CG920791. |
| **VW AID Gen2 / AD2 — Polo/T-Roc and later related MQB cluster family** | introduced ~2017 | **11.7", 1280x480** on VW's published second-generation AID | infotainment navigation map into cluster | MOST-map capable variants use the same MQB MOST path | **1010x376** for several OneB1t-supported later MOST clusters | **OEM panel resolution + community-proven map window.** OneB1t explicitly lists 17A920790 and 5NA920790D as requiring 1010x376. |
| **Škoda Octavia III 5E Virtual Cockpit — 5E0920790 / 5E0920790A** | late Octavia III / MIB2.5 era | marketed as ~10" / 10.25" VC; exact LCD raster should be kept separate from the map window | infotainment navigation map into cluster | **MOST streaming + H.264**; retrofit requires MOST optical link to 5F | **1010x376** external renderer/map window | **Vehicle-proven in this project + community-proven.** OneB1t explicitly lists 5E0920790A as a 1010x376 MOST cluster. |
| **Škoda Superb III / Kodiaq / Karoq MIB2-era VC** | ~2018-2021 | typically marketed as 10.25" VC | infotainment navigation map into cluster | retrofit/coding evidence shows **MOST_streaming + H.264** | exact window depends on cluster family; do not infer from diagonal | **Community-proven transport.** More exact part-number/viewport mapping still needed. |
| **SEAT/CUPRA MIB2-era Digital Cockpit** | similar MQB period | commonly 10.25" class | likely MQB display configuration family | likely MOST/H.264 on compatible MIB2 High targets | not frozen | **Compatibility candidate.** Needs exact part numbers and vehicle traces before promotion. |
| **MIB3 / newer Ethernet/IP cluster generations** | 2019+ depending model | multiple later panels, including Full HD generations | architecture may use IP streaming / MOST_High / other later paths | not the MIB2 baseline | target-specific | **Out of scope for this matrix unless explicitly used as a comparator.** Do not mix Golf 8 / later Audi VC-plus evidence into MHI2 decisions. |

## The two major MIB2 architectures

### A. MQB VW / Škoda: map video over MOST150

For the MQB MIB2 High family relevant to this project, several independent evidence streams converge:

```text
MIB2 High / 5F
    |
    | navigation map
    | H.264
    v
DisplayManager / DCIVIDEO
    |
    | /dev/mlb/isoTX2
    v
MOST150 optical bus
    |
    v
AID / Virtual Cockpit map surface
```

Vehicle retrofit coding repeatedly uses:

```text
Dashboard_Graphic_Variant = MOST
navigation_map_transmission_mode = MOST_streaming
navigation_map_compression_mode = H264
```

The OneB1t `VcMOSTRenderMqb` implementation independently demonstrates arbitrary/custom video reaching multiple MQB Continental/VDO clusters through the MOST map path and explicitly identifies the **DCIVIDEO Kombi Map** channel as `isoTX2`.

This matches the MU1440 path already proven by this project.

### B. Audi B9 MIB2 Virtual Cockpit: map video over LVDS

Audi service-training material explicitly distinguishes the Virtual Cockpit from the non-VC cluster:

```text
Audi B9 MIB2 / J794
    |
    | large navigation map
    | detailed intersection map
    v
LVDS
    |
    v
J285 Audi Virtual Cockpit
```

For the Audi Virtual Cockpit:

- **LVDS** carries the large navigation map and detailed intersection maps.
- **MOST** carries other content such as list menus/covers and is used for J285 software updates.
- **Infotainment CAN** carries other non-image/content communication.

For Audi's non-VC **Top** cluster, however, the same OEM material says navigation including the map is carried over **MOST** and that cluster has no LVDS interface.

This explains why an Audi stock DisplayManager configuration may contain both MOST-video and LVDS/HDMI-related capabilities without both being the active map path for the same fitted cluster.

## Audi B9 / AUG22 MU1438 implication

Contributor-supplied stock configs for the current Audi B9 lead contain:

- a MOST encoder targeting `/dev/mlb/isoTX2`;
- a `video_over_most` routing block;
- an extended `2_lvds` display mode with `Tegra:HDMI0` / display ID 4;
- HBAS profiles that select `kombi_type = lvds`.

The OEM Audi topology now gives this configuration a much stronger interpretation:

> For an actual B9 **Virtual Cockpit**, the primary large navigation-map image path should be treated as **LVDS until vehicle evidence proves otherwise**. The mere presence of `isoTX2` in the same configuration is not evidence that the VC map itself uses MOST.

The next target-specific probes should therefore identify:

1. exact J285 / Virtual Cockpit part number and HW/SW;
2. whether the vehicle is pre-facelift MIB2 rather than later MIB3;
3. the active DisplayManager display/context corresponding to the LVDS secondary output;
4. the exact geometry expected by that output;
5. how CarPlay AltScreen video can be bound to that existing display path without disturbing stock ownership.

## Panel resolution vs. map viewport

This distinction is critical.

### VW first-generation AID

Volkswagen publishes:

```text
12.3-inch panel
1440 x 540 pixels
```

for the first-generation Golf/Tiguan/Passat/Arteon AID family.

### VW second-generation AID

Volkswagen publishes:

```text
11.7-inch panel
1280 x 480 pixels
```

for the newer Polo/T-Roc AID generation.

### Later MQB MOST-map renderer window

OneB1t separately documents:

```text
windowWidth  = 1010
windowHeight = 376
```

for these later MOST clusters:

- `5NA920790D` — Tiguan
- `17A920790` — T-Roc
- `5E0920790A` — Octavia

That **1010x376 value is an external map/rendering surface**, not proof that the LCD panel itself is 1010x376.

The same 1010x376 geometry being produced by the current CarPlay Stream-111 path on the MU1440/Octavia reference vehicle is therefore a strong architectural correlation, not merely a convenient arbitrary resolution.

## Known MQB cluster part-number anchors

From the open `VcMOSTRenderMqb` compatibility list:

### Earlier / larger AID family

- `3G0920791` — Passat B8 / Arteon
- `5NA920791` — Tiguan
- `5G1920791` — Golf Mk7
- `5G1920794` — Golf Mk7 GTE
- `5G1920795` — e-Golf Mk7
- `5G1920798` — Golf Mk7
- `3CG920791` — VW Atlas

### Later MOST clusters explicitly using 1010x376 in that project

- `5NA920790D` — Tiguan
- `17A920790` — T-Roc
- `5E0920790A` — Škoda Octavia III

These part numbers are useful **family anchors**, not a universal compatibility whitelist.

## Continental FPK platform-family evidence

A VAG/SEAT regulatory marking document from Continental is unusually useful because it groups customer part numbers by Continental FPK homologation bundles.

One bundle (`17101001`) contains, among others:

- VW T-Roc: `17A 920 790` / `17A 920 790 A`;
- Škoda Superb: `3V0 920 790` / `3V0 920 790 A`;
- Škoda Kodiaq/Karoq: `565 920 790 A`;
- Škoda Octavia: `5E0 920 790` / `5E0 920 790 A` / `5E0 920 790 B`;
- SEAT Leon / A-SUV: `5F0 920 790` / `5F0 920 790 A`;
- VW Tiguan: `5NA 920 790 D`.

This is strong evidence that the later VW/Škoda/SEAT `...790` instruments belong to a **shared Continental FPK hardware/platform lineage**.

A separate Continental **FPK Standard / WFS 5a** group contains the older Golf/Passat/Tiguan `...791` families such as:

- Golf `5G1 920 791/A/B`;
- Passat `3G0 920 791/A/B/C/D`;
- Tiguan `5NA 920 791/A/B/C`.

That regulatory split independently aligns with the renderer evidence:

```text
older ...791 family
  -> OneB1t default "old cluster" renderer window: 800x480

later ...790 family
  -> selected OneB1t targets require: 1010x376
```

This does **not** prove that all units inside one homologation bundle use an identical LCD module, PCB revision or housing. It does make the working hypothesis of shared electronics/display architecture substantially stronger and gives us a concrete family boundary to test.

## Physical interchangeability / "same cluster, different housing"

There is substantial evidence for a **shared Continental/VDO MQB software/transport family** across VW and Škoda:

- the same MOST/H.264 map concepts;
- the same MIB2 `Dashboard_Display_Configuration` vocabulary;
- common renderer techniques;
- a single open renderer supports multiple VW and Škoda part-number families.

That is strong evidence for **software/display-path portability**.

It is **not yet sufficient evidence** that a VW AID and a Škoda VC can literally be cross-plugged as complete assemblies. Housing, bezel, immobilizer/component-protection data, coding, warning-lamp arrangement, fuel inputs and vehicle-specific software remain separate compatibility dimensions.

Current status of the "same LCD/electronics, different housing" idea: **shared Continental FPK platform lineage is now well supported; identical LCD/PCB and literal cross-brand plug compatibility remain hypotheses requiring teardown/label evidence**.

If someone can supply rear-label photos, PCB/LCD module numbers or teardown images from e.g. `5G1920791x`, `17A920790` and `5E0920790A`, this can be tightened substantially.

## Open-source implementation evidence

### OneB1t — VcMOSTRenderMqb

Repository: https://github.com/OneB1t/VcMOSTRenderMqb

Key facts:

- custom/VNC video to MQB Virtual Cockpit;
- supported Continental/VDO cluster list across VW and Škoda;
- `1010x376` config for the later cluster group;
- MIB2 Toolbox MOST patch can raise the legacy renderer path from roughly 10 to 20 fps;
- project works with the cluster's MOST map path.

Pinned revision already used by this project:

`27ea74abfcd77c16b5a5bdad3a0bfee24f707ab9`

### chopinwong01 — mhi2-android-auto-video-vc

Repository: https://github.com/chopinwong01/mhi2-android-auto-video-vc

This independently describes a VW MIB2.5 High pipeline:

```text
Android Auto secondary video
 -> stock GAL hook
 -> stream-player
 -> Displayable 3 / Context 70
 -> MOST150
 -> Virtual Cockpit
```

It explicitly identifies `/dev/mlb/isoTX2` as the VW-group VC navigation-video feed on its tested MHI2 VW target.

### adi961 — mib2-android-auto-vc

Repository: https://github.com/adi961/mib2-android-auto-vc

This is primarily a **metadata / native cluster UI** project rather than a full map-video renderer. It is useful because it confirms that the higher-level HMI/cluster integration layer is portable across selected VW MHI2 trains while Audi AU trains are not automatically compatible.

### chefranov — mhi2-au37x-carplay

Repository: https://github.com/chefranov/mhi2-au37x-carplay

Audi A3 8V / AU37x reference for **native route guidance and media metadata**, not proof of the B9 LVDS map-video topology. Keep the metadata plane separate from projected map video.

### Luka / MHI2Q and Lanye MMI Mirror

These remain important Audi comparator projects, especially for:

- native route-guidance metadata;
- cluster layout state;
- MMI-to-cluster mirroring;
- later Qualcomm/MHI2Q display handling.

They must not be used to overwrite exact MHI2 Harman transport evidence.

## Retrofit evidence

### Škoda Octavia III

Community retrofit documentation for `5E0920790A` repeatedly requires an added **MOST optical link from the VC to 5F** for navigation and related visual content.

### Škoda Superb III

Retrofit reports likewise use:

- `MOST_streaming`;
- `H264`;
- map-resolution adaptations;
- an actual MOST optical connection.

### VW Golf 7 AID

Community coding repeatedly uses:

- `Dashboard_Graphic_Variant = MOST`;
- `navigation_map_transmission_mode = MOST_streaming`;
- `navigation_map_compression_mode = H264`;
- MOST enabled in 5F.

Some early AID variants do not support navigation-map display despite looking otherwise similar, reinforcing the need to gate by exact part number/revision.

## Important boundary: do not mix MIB3 evidence

Later platforms may expose adaptation values such as:

- `IP_streaming`;
- `MOST_High`;
- Ethernet-oriented display architectures;
- Full-HD Audi VC-plus panels.

These are useful future comparators, but they are **not evidence for the MIB2/MHI2 transport contract**.

For example, the 2019+ Audi A4 facelift moved to MIB3 and offered a 12.3" Full-HD 1920x720 VC-plus. That is a different generation from the pre-facelift MIB2 B9 target discussed here.

## Capability admission fields for this project

Every new cluster target should eventually have these fields:

| Field | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Brand / model / model year | prevents cross-generation mixing |
| Cluster part number | primary family anchor |
| HW / SW revision | catches same-PN generation changes |
| Cluster manufacturer | useful for family grouping |
| Physical panel diagonal | descriptive only |
| Physical panel raster | must not be confused with video viewport |
| External map/video viewport | direct relevance to Stream-111 / renderer |
| Map transport | MOST / LVDS / IP / other |
| Codec | H.264 / RLE / raw / unknown |
| MIB adaptation mode | e.g. MOST_streaming |
| MIB output device | e.g. `/dev/mlb/isoTX2`, display/context ID |
| Native metadata plane | BAP/NavSD/RGI capabilities |
| Layouts | classic/sport/full/small etc. |
| Vehicle proof | exact test status |
| Recovery path | required before write-side experimentation |

## Current project conclusions

1. **Our Škoda MU1440 + AID10 path belongs to the MQB MOST/H.264 family.**
2. **1010x376 is best treated as a map/video surface geometry, not the LCD raster.**
3. **The Audi B9 MIB2 Virtual Cockpit belongs to a different map-video transport family: LVDS for the large map.**
4. **Audi B9 still uses MOST for other cluster content, so seeing MOST support in its configuration is expected and not contradictory.**
5. **Cross-brand VW/Škoda reuse is strong at the protocol/software level; literal complete-cluster interchangeability is not yet proven.**
6. **Cluster identity must become a first-class compatibility gate alongside MHI2 firmware and `libairplay.so` ABI.**
