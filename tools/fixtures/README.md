# Diagnostic source fixtures: MU1440 AID10 M1AU

This folder is permanent, vehicle-independent host diagnostic source. It is safe to keep on the public `main` branch without merging any experimental native MOST-control code.

## Why this fixture exists

The old `direct-test-1010x376-20fps.ts` bypassed M1AU/PTS/PCR and could not distinguish a faulty source clock from a downstream transport/display problem. The new 120-second, 30fps reference clip uses proper H.264 Annex-B frames, IDR/P GOP20, M1AU framing and 32.32 timestamps. A highly visible moving diagonal and frame counter expose held/repeated pictures and IDR-only presentation. The test must be injected before the normal parity mux, not as a premuxed TS directly into MOST.

- 1010×376, H.264 High L3.1, 3600 AUs, 180 IDR + 3420 P + 0 B, GOP20, nominal 30fps and 1.538 Mbps.
- 56-byte M1AU v1 header: BE magic/version/length/flags/generation IDs/sequence; LE 32.32 time fields at offsets 0x30, 0x34.

## Host regeneration utility

`python3 tools/fixtures/generate_mu1440_motion_m1au.py --output /tmp/mu1440-fixture`

Requires Python3 with numpy and ffmpeg/libx264. Emits `.h264`, `.m1au`, `AUDIT.json`, includes frame count/GOP/header checks and SHA256 fingerprints. **Not a byte-identical reconstruction guarantee** of the frozen first file; do not overwrite the old file or bypass the QNX pinned fixture SHA. Create a new named fixture revision for new bytes.

## Safe QNX playback tool (not merged)

Opt-in replay source, owner, bounded control and rollback remain isolated in [draft PR #24](https://github.com/harman-f/mhi2_altscreen_carplay/pull/24), branch `work/mu1440-fixture-replay-v1`. This ensures the untested iPhone-free native gate takeover is not silently enabled in production/main. Native pair CI #300 built green at SHA `41a472211a1572d0548aaab9f6d6bee4df5cc3e9`; later exact-hash packaging CI [#301](https://github.com/harman-f/mhi2_altscreen_carplay/actions/runs/37852559790) provides both scripts and a binary manifest when completed. Neither CI run is a live in-car AID10 display test.

Research evidence and original live CI295 baseline: [permanent Research main handoff](https://github.com/CaneTLOTW/M.I.B._Research/blob/main/projects/mhi2-altscreen-thirdparty-audit/analysis/MU1440_CARPLAY_LIVE_CI295_AND_FIXTURE_REPLAY_MASTER_2026-10-08.md).

Preserve this directory, the Research handoff, and the original hashed fixture. New fixture versions can then be generated without reconstructing the protocol, codec or visual test design from old chats.
